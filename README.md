# Joanna DeLaune - Data Analysis and Visualization

I was a data-head before being a data-head was cool, and have been working with and thinking about the gathering, storing, analysis, and processing of information for much of my career. For a lot of that time I used only basic tools such as Excel and Access. Now that I have branched out to learn Python, Pandas, SQL, MongoDB, and more, the world (of data, at least) is my chocolate bar, since I can't eat oysters.

## Projects

This two-part project uses Python to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap and GeoAPIfy APIs. Part 1 finds weather conditions in randomly selected cities around the world and creates MatPlotLib visualizations.  Part 2 selects vacation destinations based on weather conditions and plots them on a map.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Querying APIs, ETL, data analysis using linear regression, data visualization

### Pollution Isn't Minnesota Nice: EPA FRS-Monitored Sites vs. Health Outcomes, Asthma Rates, and Cancer Rates by County

This project is a full-stack web application developed in collaboration with four other people that examines the relationship between the presence and concentration of EPA Facility Registry Service (FRS)-monitored sites in Minnesota and health outcome and health factor scores in each county, as well as asthma and cancer rates by county. My part of the project was to write a Flask API that acquired data from our Mongo database and provided it in JSON and geoJSON format. I also took the lead on ensuring we prepared a robust and informative README file, and assisted with the data cleaning and sourcing.

* **Tools:** Python, Flask, Pandas, MongoDB, JavaScript, Leaflet, Plotly, Turf
* **Skills Demonstrated:** API development, research project design, collaborative project management, clear communication of findings

### State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) Spending vs. Vaccination Rates
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) allocated $350 billion to state and local governments to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 public health emergency by funding programs across a broad spectrum of categories. By the end of Q4 2022, some states (and their local governments) had used almost all the money available to them. Other states had neither spent nor obligated the vast majority of the money available for their use.

We wondered whether states where this SLFRF money was spent on programs to improve the vaccine uptake for residents would have higher rates of vaccination.

We compared both the **amount of money spent** on vaccine-related projects and the **number of vaccine-related projects** to the vaccination rate in each state, using publicly available vaccination data from the CDC. Data on SLFRF spending was compiled by Dave Kamper of the Economic Policy Institute.

# Joanna DeLaune - Data Analysis and Visualization

I was a data-head before being a data-head was cool, and have been working with and thinking about the gathering, storing, analysis, and processing of information for much of my career. For a lot of that time I used only basic tools such as Excel and Access. Now that I have branched out to learn Python, Pandas, SQL, MongoDB, and more, the world (of data, at least) is my chocolate bar, since I can't eat oysters.

## Projects
* [Getting Out of the USA: A Python API project with MatPlotLib Visualizations](https://github.com/joannadelaune/joannadelaune/edit/main/README.md#getting-out-of-the-usa-a-python-api-project-with-matplotlib-visualizations)

This two-part project uses Python to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap and GeoAPIfy APIs. Part 1 finds weather conditions in randomly selected cities around the world and creates MatPlotLib visualizations.  Part 2 selects vacation destinations based on weather conditions and plots them on a map.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Querying APIs, ETL, analysis using linear regression, data visualization

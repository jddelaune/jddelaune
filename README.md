# Joanna DeLaune - Data Analysis and Visualization

I was a data-head before being a data-head was cool, and have been working with and thinking about the gathering, storing, analysis, and processing of information for much of my career. For a lot of that time I used only basic tools such as Excel and Access. Now that I have branched out to learn Python, Pandas, SQL, MongoDB, and more, the world (of data, at least) is my chocolate bar, since I can't eat oysters.

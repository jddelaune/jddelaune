# Joanna DeLaune - Data Analysis and Visualization

I was a data-head before being a data-head was cool, and have been working with and thinking about the gathering, storing, analysis, and processing of information for much of my career. For a lot of that time I used only basic tools such as Excel and Access. Now that I have branched out to learn Python, Pandas, SQL, MongoDB, and more, the world (of data, at least) is my chocolate bar, since I can't eat oysters.

This two-part project uses Python to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap and GeoAPIfy APIs. Part 1 finds weather conditions in randomly selected cities around the world and creates MatPlotLib visualizations.  Part 2 selects vacation destinations based on weather conditions and plots them on a map.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Querying APIs, ETL, analysis using linear regression, data visualization

### State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) Spending vs. Vaccination Rates
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) allocated $350 billion to state and local governments to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 public health emergency by funding programs across a broad spectrum of categories. By the end of Q4 2022, some states (and their local governments) had used almost all the money available to them. Other states had neither spent nor obligated the vast majority of the money available for their use.

We wondered whether states where this SLFRF money was spent on programs to improve the vaccine uptake for residents would have higher rates of vaccination.

We compared both the **amount of money spent** on vaccine-related projects and the **number of vaccine-related projects** to the vaccination rate in each state, using publicly available vaccination data from the CDC. Data on SLFRF spending was compiled by Dave Kamper of the Economic Policy Institute.
